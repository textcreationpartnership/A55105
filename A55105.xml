            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IT hath been one of the moſt ſucceſsful Stratagems of the Apoſtate Prince of Darkneſs, to Ruin Mens Souls by thoſe very means which were ordained for their Salvation; and this Policy of his appears in no Inſtance more evident, than in the Methods he has taken to make the Euchariſt a means of Deſtruction; while by unworthily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, Men <hi>eat and drink damnation to themſelves.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence his faithful Servants, the Authors of that Myſtery of Iniquity, Popery, have made Tranſubſtantiation a Teſt of their Catholiſm, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and damning Men for being Men; that is, for uſing their Sence and Reaſon: With one hand robbing us of the Holy Sacrament, and its proper Uſes; and with the other, preſenting us with a piece of Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and requiring our Adoration of a ſenſeleſs Idol.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was Inſtituted by our Bleſſed Saviour, in Remembrance of himſelf, and as a bond of Union among his Followers. 'Tis the peculiar Right of ſuch who by ſound Faith, well digeſted Knowledge, and ſome Experience of the Comforts and Pleaſures that Reſult from a Good Conſcience, and Holy Converſation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33718:2"/>are made to long for further Degrees of Conformity to the Will of God, clearer Manifeſtations of the Divine Love, and more evident Signs of the Soul's Recovery from its fallen ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The Motives to come to it ought to be from within, or elſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and not from beneath; and the Things to be obtained by it, ought to be increaſe of ſpiritual Bleſſings, and not of outward Emoluments.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed is that Nation where the Government can find men otherwiſe fitted for Publick Employments, whoſe uſe of this Sacrament appears by their Converſations, to proceed from ſuch Principles; and ſurely he who loves the Commemoration of the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Rev. 5.</note> Prince of the Kings of the Earth, in this way of his own Inſtitution, has an excellent Qualification to Recommend him to thoſe Vicegerents of that Prince, who deſire and deſign to promote his Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, to give a plain Anſwer to your Queſtion, I am of Opinion, That it is at leaſt inconvenient, to impoſe the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper on every Man that executes an Office in Publick Adminiſtrations; and that among others, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Ordinance was Inſtituted to other Ends; and I know not when the Warrant was ſigned by our Saviour, to uſe it to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—'Tis his Great Seal, and ought not to be put to any Commiſſions but his own.</p>
                  <p>No Man who is fit for it, needs a Law to bring him to it; all the Souldiers of the<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. If this Teſt be eſtabliſht, 'tis the Duty of all Men in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Places to keep from Offices, all that are guilty of Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, and the other parts of a prophane Life, which are obvious to common ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rvation; for thoſe things evidently unfit Men to receive the Sacrament: And if the Government ſhould permit no Man to be in any Office that drinks to exceſs, or miſpends his time in tipling, that uſes to ſwear in common diſcourſe, or whoſe Life other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears vitious, what multitudes of places would be empty, which are now well filled for the Publick Intereſt? And yet what a Cruelty would it be to any vitious Man, to put him under a neceſſity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the Sacrament, by putting him into Office—For it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that not only every Man that lives in the Practice of any known Vice, but every Man that lives not in a daily endeavour to perform his Covenant made in Baptiſm with the moſt Bleſſed Trinity, ought to keep far from the Sacred Table.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I know it is objected, that all Men ought to be fit for the Sacrament, and that it will tend much to promote a Good Life, that they be under a neceſſity to receive it—But let Experience ſpeak—Mens Stomachs have ſcarce yet digeſted the Sacraments, which they have prophaned, for ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33718:2"/>Years paſt, to keep their Places—Men have taken the Sacrament, and betrayed their Country, and ruined their honeſt Neighbours, taken the Sacrament, and introduc'd Popery; taken the Sacrament, and murdered Men by colour of Law; and who is there (of a Subject) among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Grievances of the Nation, that took not the Sacrament to enable him ſo to be? Not to mention Perſons of better Rank, how many Vintners, Ale-Houſe-keepers, and others of like Profeſſion, have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed their Licenſes at the hazard of their Souls? And I dare appeal to all Men, to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, whether within their knowledge any Reformation hath been wrought thereby. Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred have refuſed it for Conſcience-ſake for one profane Perſon that has ſcrupled it. And who, and where is he whoſe Life hath been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by being under this neceſſity?—But if the univerſal depravity of Mens Manners be compared with the univerſal attendance that was paid of late at the Communion-Table, what a dreadful Proſpect is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereby to any conſidering Mind? If of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who Received unworthily, <hi>many were</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. The Generations to come ſhall call them Bleſſed, who inſtead of forcing Men to the Sacrament, uſe all means Divinely inſtituted, to make them ſit for it.—The Primitive Biſhops kept Men <hi>Catechumens</hi> for a long time, and admitted none to the Sacrament, till they were approved and practical Chriſtians. And if the Inhabitants, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Children of <hi>England,</hi> were every where made <hi>Catechumens</hi> by Publick Authority, the next Generation may probably fill all Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments with Men, who would approach the Sacrament both to the Publick Advantage and their own; for the appearances of Divine Providence in the World are now conſpicuous, and at all times, (but eſpecially in thoſe days wherein God is pleaſed more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to take to himſelf his<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1.17.</note> great Power and Reign) Good Men are Publick Bleſſings.

                  <p n="7">7. I muſt confeſs it is difficult to me to find out any plauſible Reaſon for this Device; ſure it is not worth a while to make ſuch a Teſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a diſputable Poſture, or to tempt all Hypocrites into the Church; for 'tis ten to one that he that comes to the Sacrament becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have an Employment without it, is an Hypocrite; and it is as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to one, but the Proteſtant that loſes an Office, becauſe he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, is an honeſt Man, is a true and uſeful Subject.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It cannot be an equivalent to the aforeſaid Dangers that hereby ſome Papiſts may be kept from Employment, for he is greatly miſtaken that believes the Sacrament to be the ſtrength of the Teſt; Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is the thing which the Papiſt cannot renounce; for Men are fond of Gods of their own making, but he may well Communicate with the Church, as by the Examples of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Obadiah Walker,</hi> and others, is plainly evinc'd; and the Reaſon is as plain as the Fact, for he either believes that we have no Goſpel-Prieſts, and takes the Bread and the Wine as common Food: Or if he allows our Prieſts power to Conſecrate, he may adore the Bread very conveniently upon his knees.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Beſides Papiſts in Diſguiſe are no ways dreadful when they have no Protection or favour from Court. They have been happily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the ſhort time of Father <hi>Petre</hi>'s Miniſtry, and muſt never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to live unknown or unhated in <hi>England</hi> any more. So that now upon the whole matter, the Sum of what I have offered is this.</p>
